# Luma
Program to unite the internet and filesystem.

## Building
```sh
cargo build
```

## Testing
```sh
cargo test
cargo clippy
```

## Development
General idea is that it takes applications that already exists and unifies
them. It follows unix philosiphy in letter other programs do other things
better.

I have lots of ideas for what this could be in the thing but many of them have
been moved to [neomacs](https://github.com/gingerfocus/neomacs).
